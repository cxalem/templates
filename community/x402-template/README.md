# X402 Next.js Solana Template

**A simple Next.js starter template with X402 payment protocol integration for Solana.**

This template demonstrates a streamlined implementation of the X402 payment protocol using the `x402-next` package, making it easy to add cryptocurrency payment gates to your Next.js applications.

> ⚠️ **Using on Mainnet?** This template is configured for testnet (devnet) by default. To accept real payments on mainnet, you'll need to set up CDP API keys and configure a fee payer. See the [CDP X402 Mainnet Documentation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/quickstart-for-sellers#running-on-mainnet) for complete setup instructions.

## What is X402?

**X402** is an open payment protocol that uses HTTP status code **402 "Payment Required"** to enable seamless cryptocurrency payments for web content and APIs.

### Key Benefits

- **Direct Payments** - Accept cryptocurrency payments without third-party payment processors
- **No Accounts** - No user registration or authentication required
- **Blockchain-Verified** - Payments are verified directly on the Solana blockchain
- **Simple Integration** - Add payment gates to any Next.js route with middleware
- **Flexible Pricing** - Set different prices for different content

### How It Works

```
1. User requests protected content
2. Server responds with 402 Payment Required
3. User makes payment via Coinbase Pay or crypto wallet
4. User proves payment with transaction signature
5. Server verifies on blockchain and grants access
```

---

## Features

- **X402 Payment Middleware** - Powered by `x402-next` package  
- **Solana Integration** - Uses Solana blockchain for payment verification
- **Multiple Price Tiers** - Configure different prices for different routes  
- **Session Management** - Automatic session handling after payment  
- **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support with Viem types  
- **Next.js 16** - Built on the latest Next.js App Router  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- pnpm, npm, or yarn
- A Solana wallet address to receive payments

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or create from template
npx create-solana-dapp my-app --template x402-template

# Navigate to project
cd my-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your app running.

### Test the Payment Flow

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click on "Access Cheap Content" or "Access Expensive Content"
3. You'll be presented with a Coinbase Pay payment dialog
4. Complete the payment
5. Access is granted and you'll see the protected content

---

## How It Works

This template uses the `x402-next` package which provides middleware to handle the entire payment flow.

### Middleware Configuration

The core of the payment integration is in `middleware.ts`:

```typescript
import { Address } from 'viem'
import { paymentMiddleware, Resource, Network } from 'x402-next'
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// Your Solana wallet address that receives payments
const address = 'CmGgLQL36Y9ubtTsy2zmE46TAxwCBm66onZmPPhUWNqv' as Address
const network = 'solana-devnet' as Network
const facilitatorUrl = 'https://x402.org/facilitator' as Resource
const cdpClientKey = '3uyu43EHCwgVIQx6a8cIfSkxp6cXgU30'

const x402PaymentMiddleware = paymentMiddleware(
  address,
  {
    '/content/cheap': {
      price: '$0.01',
      config: {
        description: 'Access to cheap content',
      },
      network,
    },
    '/content/expensive': {
      price: '$0.25',
      config: {
        description: 'Access to expensive content',
      },
      network,
    },
  },
  {
    url: facilitatorUrl,
  },
  {
    cdpClientKey,
    appLogo: '/logos/x402-examples.png',
    appName: 'x402 Demo',
    sessionTokenEndpoint: '/api/x402/session-token',
  },
)

export const middleware = (req: NextRequest) => {
  const delegate = x402PaymentMiddleware as unknown as (
    request: NextRequest,
  ) => ReturnType<typeof x402PaymentMiddleware>
  return delegate(req)
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
    '/',
  ],
}
```

### What Happens Under the Hood

1. **Request Interception** - Middleware checks if the requested route requires payment
2. **Payment Check** - If the route is protected, middleware checks for valid payment session
3. **402 Response** - If no valid payment, returns 402 with payment requirements
4. **Coinbase Pay Widget** - User sees payment modal powered by Coinbase
5. **Payment Verification** - After payment, transaction is verified on Solana blockchain via facilitator
6. **Session Creation** - Valid payment creates a session token
7. **Access Granted** - User can now access protected content

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The template uses sensible defaults, but you can customize by creating a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Your Solana wallet address (where payments go)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_solana_address_here

# Network (solana-devnet or solana-mainnet-beta)
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=solana-devnet

# Coinbase Pay Client Key (get from Coinbase Developer Portal)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_CLIENT_KEY=your_client_key_here

# Facilitator URL (service that verifies payments)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACILITATOR_URL=https://x402.org/facilitator
```

### Customizing Routes and Prices

Edit `middleware.ts` to add or modify protected routes:

```typescript
const x402PaymentMiddleware = paymentMiddleware(
  address,
  {
    '/premium': {
      price: '$1.00',
      config: {
        description: 'Premium content access',
      },
      network: 'solana-mainnet-beta',
    },
    '/api/data': {
      price: '$0.05',
      config: {
        description: 'API data access',
      },
      network: 'solana-mainnet-beta',
    },
  },
  // ... rest of config
)
```

### Network Selection

You can use different networks:

- `solana-devnet` - For testing (use test tokens)
- `solana-mainnet-beta` - For production (real money!)
- `solana-testnet` - Alternative test network

---

## Usage

### Creating Protected Content

Simply create pages under protected routes defined in your middleware:

```tsx
// app/content/premium/page.tsx
export default async function PremiumPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Premium Content</h1>
      <p>This content requires payment to access.</p>
      {/* Your protected content here */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Adding New Price Tiers

1. Add the route configuration in `middleware.ts`
2. Create the corresponding page component
3. Users will automatically be prompted to pay when accessing the route

### Testing with Devnet

When using `solana-devnet`:
- Payments use test tokens (no real money)
- Perfect for development and testing
- Get test tokens from [Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/)

### Going to Production

To accept real payments:
1. Change network to `solana-mainnet-beta` in `middleware.ts`
2. Update your wallet address to your production wallet
3. Test thoroughly before deploying!
4. Consider implementing additional security measures

3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure Coinbase Pay client key is valid

### 402 Errors Not Displaying

1. Check middleware matcher configuration in `middleware.ts`
2. Verify route paths match your page structure
3. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next && pnpm dev`

### Session Not Persisting

1. Check that cookies are enabled in your browser
2. Verify session token endpoint is configured
3. Check for CORS issues if using custom domains
